        <p class="card-text">Triptracker was the result of busy travellers who wish to plan for a trip but find it hard to decide on what activities to do while creating an itinerary. Through research, users mentioned that planning a trip took a lot of time and research to find what they want or what fit in their itinerary within budget. As a result, a mobile app was developed to cater toward the user's needs and wants by creating a personalized itinerary based off a short survey. From this, the users are able to customize their personalized itinerary even further if they wish to change anything</p>

        <p class="card-text">The project began by developing a proto persona to figure out the target audience. From there a survey was sent out to people who travel for leisure to gather data on potential users and their top pain points when planning a trip.

        Over 80% of users ended up mentioning they had trouble finding how to plan their trip and a lot of people preferred to have someone plan out their trip as they "had no time to research" or felt overwhelmed with choices. 5 Participants were then interviewed 1 on 1 to explain their process and thoughts more in depth when planning a trip. The goal of this was to learn more about their thought process and behaviors as they travel to know what they want.

        <p class="card-text">Based on the research, the target audience was changed from general travellers to busy individuals with limited time or who don't want to plan an entire trip by themselves.
        <br>  
        <br> Participants mentioned that they had an idea of where they want to go, however it would take them days to plan or they felt overwhelmed by the amount of information online. When asked why they didn't go with a travel agency, a majority mentioned that they did not want to spend money for a set trip that was not catered to them. All the interviewers in fact had mentioned time and money were their top priority and this had affected many decisions when planning. An empathy map was then made with the interview notes to understand the users thoughts and behaviors.

To fully understand the user, one must empathize with them and view things from their perspective so many of the ideas were based off of the user's stories. From that, a feature prioritization chart sort out the most useful and effect features for both the company and user.
        <br> 
        <br> A competitor analysis was also done while completing this to learn from the competitors SWOT analysis. The goal of this was to evaluate and define what make Triptracker different from the other travel apps out there.

        <p class="card-text">At the end of this project, users were able to create a personalized itinerary in a matter of minutes rather than days after researching places to go. Users were satisfied with being able to save time and were still able to customize the itinerary even further.
           <br>
         <br> Overall researching and designing for this app has allowed me to explore, learn and apply each step of UX and UI Design. After a lot of research and iterations I have learned that some things may not seem as straight forward or obvious to the user. Also it is best to stick to 1 feature at a time as things can quickly confusing with so many screens and options. In the future, I would like to iterate more on user requested features that can further ease the process of planning a trip such as booking flights, accomodations and paid experiences.
